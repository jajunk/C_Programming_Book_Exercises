## C Programming Language (K&R)

Good book if a littel dry and old school. Some outdated information even in the beginning. I am good following it though. The exercises are enough to get the code on paper and compiling.

## Beej's C Book

Much better for reading. Better prose and is more approachable. Just how the writer writes and keeps me endgaged. The exercises are deep early and more focused on getting code written and not so much theory in the beginning. Als references to other languages often. That makes for a broader understanding of programming in general. The humor doesn't hurt either.
